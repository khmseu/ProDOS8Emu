# third_party_docs

This directory is a local cache for third-party documentation used during development.

- Intended for convenience (offline access, reproducible references, and keeping research close to the code).
- Content may come from many sources, especially but not exclusively the internet (web pages, PDFs, specs, etc.).
- Do not assume anything in here is authoritative; prefer the upstream source when possible.

## Notes

- Only add material you are allowed to store and redistribute in this repository.
- If licensing/permission is unclear, keep it uncommitted locally or store only links + small non-copyrightable excerpts.
- Keep paths stable once referenced by plans/tests so future work remains reproducible.
